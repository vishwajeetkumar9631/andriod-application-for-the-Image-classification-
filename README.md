## Android CIFAR-10 Image Classification App ##
This Android application allows users to classify images into 10 CIFAR-10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. Users can upload an image from their device or capture one using the camera, and the app sends it to a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model for classification. The model predicts the class probabilities and returns the most likely label along with confidence scores for all classes. The app demonstrates mobile deployment of deep learning models and provides a user-friendly interface for real-time image classification.
** Android CIFAR-10 Image Classification App
This Android application implements an image classification system for the CIFAR-10 dataset using a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model. The app allows users to upload or capture an image on their device, and then classifies it into one of the 10 CIFAR classes:
Classes:
['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

The app is designed for mobile devices, providing a user-friendly interface to run deep learning inference locally or via a Flask backend server.

Features

Image Upload or Capture: Users can select an image from the device gallery or capture it using the camera.

Preprocessing: Images are resized to 32x32 pixels (CIFAR-10 size) and normalized before classification.

Prediction: The app sends the image to a TensorFlow model (hosted locally or via Flask API) and receives class probabilities.

Results Display: Displays the predicted label and confidence scores for all 10 classes in descending order.

Cross-Platform Backend Support: Can communicate with a Flask server hosting the model or use TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference.

** Technical Details

Android Development: Java/Kotlin using Android Studio.

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras for model development.

Model: Pre-trained CNN model trained on CIFAR-10 dataset.

Backend: Flask REST API (optional) to handle image classification requests.

Image Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and batch dimension expansion.

Output: JSON response with predicted labels and confidence scores.

** Workflow

User opens the app and uploads an image.

The image is preprocessed to match the CIFAR-10 input size.

The image is sent to the classification model (locally or via API).

The model predicts probabilities for each class.

The app displays the top prediction along with confidence values for all classes.
